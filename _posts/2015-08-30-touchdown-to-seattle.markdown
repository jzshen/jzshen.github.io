Hello friends and strangers!

DAY 1

What's up Seatttleeeee? 
What can I say, I'm still pumped! I landed at Seattle airport around 7pm the other day, the ride was long (approx 6 hours), but "The Age of Adeline", 3 episodes of "Modern Family", 2 episodes of "The Big Bang Theory", and a friendly neighbour got me through it. Here are some pictures of the plane ride... :)

Amazing!

But still, getting off was the best part! I was so releaved to not be confined in the air and use the airport washroom. Then I got my luggage, and headed straight to Bellevue.

The taxi driver was very friendly, he told me was from an Ethiopian decent, so I asked him if he liked the Weeknd, and he did. So we got to bond over that.

When I got to apartment, I was actually pretty surprised about how spacious and nice it was.

I can get used to this... (and hopefully I contine making my bed haha)!

And after all the settling in, I called it a night! As eager as I was to checkout the city, the night got the best of me, and I knew there'd be 4 good months to do so. ;) 

See ya later!
