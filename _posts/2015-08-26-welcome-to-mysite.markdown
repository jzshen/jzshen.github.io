Hello friends and strangers!

I decided to change up my website a bit, it is still very much static (powered by Jekyll) and very simple, but I don't really need much more. Jekyll is very easy to use and quite honestly did most of the work. Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions on how to improve my website! Or if you just want to get in touch.

Thanks for reading!

Jennifer Shen
